      - name: "No Real People Names in Style References"
        mode: error
        instructions: |
          Never allow references to real people by name in:
          - Plugin commands
          - Skill documentation
          - Example prompts or instructions
          - Style references (e.g., "in the style of <person>")

          Instead, require explicit descriptions of desired qualities (e.g., "direct and technically precise"
          instead of "like <specific person>").

          Flag ANY instance where a real person's name is used as a style reference or example.

      - name: "No Assumed Git Remote Names"
        mode: error
        instructions: |
          Code should NEVER assume git remote names like "origin" or "upstream" without first discovering them.

          ❌ Bad examples:
          - `git push origin main`
          - `git fetch upstream`
          - `git remote add origin <url>`
          - Using "origin" or "upstream" in instructions without checking first

          ✅ Good examples:
          - `git remote -v` to discover remotes first
          - `git branch -vv` to check tracking branches
          - Instructions that say "discover the remote name first"

          Flag any hardcoded remote name usage in commands, skills, or documentation.

      - name: "Git Push Safety Rules"
        mode: error
        instructions: |
          1. Commands and skills must NEVER push without explicit user permission
             - Must ask the user before pushing
             - Cannot push autonomously

          2. NEVER allow pushing to main or master branches
             - Reject `git push <remote> main`
             - Reject `git push <remote> master`
             - Reject any push to main/master variants

          3. NEVER allow force push operations anywhere
             - Reject `git push -f`
             - Reject `git push --force`
             - Reject `git push --force-with-lease`
             - Reject any force push variant

          ❌ Always reject:
          - `git push` without user confirmation
          - `git push origin main`
          - `git push upstream master`
          - `git push -f` (any force push variant)
          - `git push --force`
          - `git push --force-with-lease`
          - Automated push workflows

          ✅ Allow:
          - `git push` to feature branches after asking user
          - Instructions that say "ask the user before pushing"
          - Documentation about push workflows (without executing)

          Flag any git push without user confirmation, any push to main/master, or any force push.

      - name: "No Untrusted MCP Servers"
        mode: error
        instructions: |
          Code should NEVER introduce MCP (Model Context Protocol) server installations from untrusted sources.

          ❌ Reject:
          - Random npm packages for MCP servers
          - Arbitrary GitHub repositories
          - Unofficial or unverified MCP servers
          - Any `npx @<random-org>/mcp-server-*` installations

          Flag any introduction of new MCP server dependencies and require justification and security review.

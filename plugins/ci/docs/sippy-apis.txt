Various sippy APIs that can be manually used with curl:

### List all test failures from a PR

Check for all test failures from a PR, both presubmit and /payload jobs: 

```
curl "https://sippy.dptools.openshift.org/api/pull_requests/test_results?org=openshift&repo=origin&pr_number=30752&start_date=2026-02-02&end_date=2026-02-05" | jq | less
```

### List all changes in a payload

This lists all changes in a specific payload that were not in the previous payload. This is helpful when you've found a clear start point for a problem and want to see what change may have caused the issue. 

```curl
curl "https://sippy.dptools.openshift.org/api/payloads/diff?toPayload=4.22.0-0.nightly-2026-01-15-114134"  | jq | less
```

fromPayload can be specified if you'd like to check a greater range of payloads.

# Job Notes

Notes on what specific job naming patterns mean, and where to find help when they go bad.

### ROSA Classic
Jobs mentioning `rosa-sts-ovn` are ROSA classic jobs such as periodic-ci-openshift-release-master-nightly-4.22-e2e-rosa-sts-ovn. A good contact point for these jobs is #wg-hcm-ocp-release-enablement. 

### Insights Operator Jobs

Jobs containing `insights-operator` (such as periodic-ci-openshift-insights-operator-release-4.22-periodics-e2e-aws-techpreview) are from the Insights Operator team, and while we do currently monitor them for regressions in component readiness, they sit somewhat outside the normal flows of OCP. Best contact point when these jobs go bad is

## Name
meet:find-time

## Synopsis
```
/meet:find-time <email_addresses> [duration_in_minutes] [days_ahead]
```

## Description
The `meet:find-time` command helps you find overlapping available time with people by analyzing calendar availability across multiple participants and suggesting optimal meeting times.

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Parse and Validate Arguments
- Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to extract email addresses, duration, and optional date range
- Validate email format for all participants 
- Set default duration to be 30 minutes
- Set default date range if not provided (e.g., next 7 days)
- Convert duration to minutes if provided in other formats

### Phase 2: Gather Free/Busy Information
- Use the `get-freebusy` tool from the `plugin:meet:google-calendar` MCP server to get busy times for all participants
- Query the specified days_ahead for each participant's calendar
- Get current time and primary calendar timezone using `get-current-time`

### Phase 3: Analyze Available Time Slots
- Calculate free blocks by inverting busy periods for each participant
- Find overlapping free time across all participants
- Filter out blocks shorter than the requested duration
- Dismiss free blocks that are earlier than the current time
- Exclude weekends unless specifically requested
- Consider 9 AM - 6 PM as default preference

### Phase 4: Generate Meeting Suggestions
- Sort potential meeting times by preference (earlier in week, business hours, etc.)
- Present top 3-5 options with clear time formatting
- Display times in the user's primary calendar timezone
- Include day of week and date for clarity
- Provide alternative suggestions if no perfect matches found

### Phase 5: Error Handling
- Handle cases where no common free time exists
- Provide helpful suggestions (shorter duration, different date range)
- If you can't access a calendar, give up the operation gracefully. Then tell the user that the email adress maybe wrong
- Validate that all email addresses have accessible calendars

## Return Value
- **Format**: Structured list of available meeting times
- **Content**:
  - Meeting time options with date, time, and timezone
  - Duration confirmation
  - List of all participants
  - Alternative suggestions if limited availability

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Jira MCP server configured
- Optional: `gh` CLI tools installed and configured, for GitHub access.

### Setting up Jira MCP Server

```bash
# Start the atlassian mcp server using podman
podman run -i --rm -p 8080:8080 -e "JIRA_URL=https://issues.redhat.com" -e "JIRA_USERNAME" -e "JIRA_PERSONAL_TOKEN" -e "JIRA_SSL_VERIFY" ghcr.io/sooperset/mcp-atlassian:latest --transport sse --port 8080 -vv
```

Add the MCP server to Claude:

```bash
# Add the Atlassian MCP server
claude mcp add --transport sse atlassian http://localhost:8080/sse
```

#### Getting Tokens

For your Jira token, use https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?selectedTab=com.atlassian.pats.pats-plugin:jira-user-personal-access-tokens

### Notes and tips

- Do not commit real tokens. If you must keep a project-local file, prefer committing a `mcp.json.sample` with placeholders, and keep your real `mcp.json` untracked.
- Consider using the [rh-pre-commit](https://source.redhat.com/departments/it/it_information_security/leaktk/leaktk_components/rh_pre_commit) hook to scan for secrets accidentally left in commits.
- The `atlassian` server example uses an MCP container image: `ghcr.io/sooperset/mcp-atlassian:latest`.
- If you prefer Docker, replace the `podman` command with `docker` (arguments are typically the same).
- If Podman is installed via Podman Machine on macOS, ensure it is running: `podman machine start`.
- Keep `JIRA_SSL_VERIFY` as "true" unless you have a specific reason to disable TLS verification.
- Limit active MCP servers: running too many at once can degrade performance or hit limits. Use Cursor's MCP panel to disable those you don't need for the current session.

## Installation

Ensure you have the ai-helpers marketplace enabled, via [the instructions here](/README.md).

```bash
# Install the plugin
/plugin install jira@ai-helpers
```

## Available Commands

### `/jira:solve` - Analyze and Solve JIRA Issues

Analyze a JIRA issue and create a pull request to solve it. The command fetches issue details, analyzes the codebase, creates an implementation plan, makes the necessary changes, and creates a PR with conventional commits.

**Usage:**
```bash
/jira:solve OCPBUGS-12345 enxebre
```

See [commands/solve.md](commands/solve.md) for full documentation.

---

### `/jira:status-rollup` - Generate Weekly Status Rollups

Generate comprehensive status rollup comments for any Jira issue by recursively analyzing all child issues and their activity within a date range. The command extracts insights from changelogs and comments to create well-formatted status summaries.

**Usage:**
```bash
/jira:status-rollup FEATURE-123 --start-date 2025-10-08 --end-date 2025-10-14
```

See [commands/status-rollup.md](commands/status-rollup.md) for full documentation.

---

### `/jira:grooming` - Backlog Grooming Assistant

Analyze and organize new bugs and cards added over a specified time period to prepare for grooming meetings. The command provides automated data collection, intelligent analysis, and generates structured, actionable meeting agendas.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Single project
/jira:grooming OCPSTRAT last-week

# Multiple OpenShift projects
/jira:grooming "OCPSTRAT,OCPBUGS,HOSTEDCP" last-week

# Filter by component
/jira:grooming OCPSTRAT last-week --component "Control Plane"

# Filter by label
/jira:grooming OCPSTRAT last-week --label "technical-debt"

# Combine filters
/jira:grooming OCPSTRAT last-week --component "Control Plane" --label "security"
```
See [commands/grooming.md](commands/grooming.md) for full documentation.

---

### `/jira:generate-test-plan` - Generate Test Steps

Generate comprehensive test steps for a JIRA issue by analyzing related pull requests. The command supports auto-discovery of PRs from the JIRA issue or manual specification of specific PRs to analyze.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Auto-discover all PRs from JIRA
/jira:generate-test-plan CNTRLPLANE-205

# Test only specific PRs
/jira:generate-test-plan CNTRLPLANE-205 https://github.com/openshift/hypershift/pull/6888
```

See [commands/generate-test-plan.md](commands/generate-test-plan.md) for full documentation.

---

### `/jira:create` - Create Jira Issues

Create well-formed Jira issues (stories, epics, features, tasks, bugs) with intelligent defaults, interactive guidance, and validation. The command applies project-specific conventions, suggests components based on context, and provides templates for consistent issue creation.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Create a story
/jira:create story MYPROJECT "Add user dashboard"

# Create a story with options
/jira:create story MYPROJECT "Add search functionality" --component "Frontend" --version "2.5.0"

# Create an epic with parent
/jira:create epic MYPROJECT "Mobile application redesign" --parent MYPROJECT-100

# Create a bug
/jira:create bug MYPROJECT "Login button doesn't work on mobile"

# Create a bug with component
/jira:create bug MYPROJECT "API returns 500 error" --component "Backend"

# Create a task
/jira:create task MYPROJECT "Update API documentation" --parent MYPROJECT-456

# Create a feature
/jira:create feature MYPROJECT "Advanced search capabilities"
```

**Key Features:**
- **Universal requirements** - All tickets MUST include Security Level: Red Hat Employee and label: ai-generated-jira
- **Smart defaults** - Project and team-specific conventions applied automatically
- **Interactive templates** - Guides you through user story format, acceptance criteria, bug templates
- **Security validation** - Scans for credentials and secrets before submission
- **Extensible** - Supports project-specific and team-specific skills for custom workflows
- **Hybrid workflow** - Required fields as arguments, optional fields as interactive prompts

**Project-Specific Conventions:**

Different projects may have different conventions (security levels, labels, versions, components, etc.). The command automatically detects your project and applies the appropriate conventions via project-specific skills.

**Team-Specific Conventions:**

Teams may have additional conventions layered on top of project conventions (component selection, custom fields, workflows, etc.). The command automatically detects team context and applies team-specific skills.

See [commands/create.md](commands/create.md) for full documentation.

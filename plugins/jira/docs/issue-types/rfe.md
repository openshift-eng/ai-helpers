# RFE (Request for Enhancement) Guide

Guide on Jira RFEs: customer-driven enhancement requests that capture external requests for new functionality or improvements.

## Usage

```bash
# Create an RFE (Request for Enhancement) (uses common/rfe.yaml template by default)
/jira:create rfe RFE "Support for custom CA certificates in cluster configuration"

# Override with a specific template
/jira:create rfe RFE "Support custom CA certs" --template common/rfe
```

**Templates:** For more information on templates, see the [Template Guide](../../templates/README.md).

---

## What is an RFE?

An RFE (Request for Enhancement) is:
- A **customer-driven request** for new functionality or improvements
- Captured from **external sources** (support cases, customer conversations, field feedback)
- Focused on **customer needs** and business justification
- The **input mechanism** for product planning from the field
- May become a Feature after evaluation and prioritization

### RFE Characteristics

RFEs should:
- Represent **actual customer need** (not internal engineering ideas)
- Include **business justification** and impact
- Reference **specific use cases** and customer scenarios
- Identify **affected components** and teams
- Be evaluated by product management for roadmap fit

## RFE vs Feature

| Aspect | RFE | Feature |
|--------|-----|---------|
| **Origin** | External (customer, support, field) | Internal (product strategy) |
| **Focus** | Customer problem and use case | Market problem and strategic value |
| **Stage** | Input/request phase | Approved/planned phase |
| **Owner** | Customer success, support, field | Product management |
| **Outcome** | May become Feature, Epic, or Story | Implemented as Epics and Stories |

### When to Use Each

**RFE:**
- Customer requests new capability
- Support escalation for missing functionality
- Field team identifies pattern of customer asks
- Partner requests integration or feature
- Not yet approved for roadmap

**Feature:**
- Approved strategic initiative on roadmap
- Internal product planning for market need
- Cross-team effort spanning quarters
- Already committed to customers

## RFE Components

### 1. Summary

Brief description of the requested enhancement (5-10 words max)

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Support custom SSL certificates for ROSA HCP"
- ✅ "Enable multi-region disaster recovery for ARO"
- ✅ "Add FIPS 140-2 compliance mode for HyperShift"
- ✅ "Support private link connectivity for hosted control planes"

### 2. Nature and Description

**What to include:**
- What is being requested?
- What doesn't work today (current limitation)?
- What should work (desired behavior)?
- How will customers use this (use case)?

**Example:**
```text
**Nature and Description**

**Current Limitation:**
ROSA HCP customers cannot use custom SSL certificates for cluster ingress.
All clusters use certificates issued by Red Hat's CA, which doesn't meet
enterprise security policies requiring organization-issued certificates.

**Desired Behavior:**
Customers should be able to provide their own SSL certificates (wildcard or
multi-domain) for cluster ingress, validated by their organization's CA.
Certificates should be configurable at cluster creation or post-installation.

**Use Case:**
Enterprise customers with strict security policies require all SSL/TLS
certificates to be issued by their internal CA for audit compliance.
Current limitation forces policy exceptions or prevents ROSA adoption.
```

### 3. Business Requirements

**What to include:**
- Why is this important to customers?
- What business impact does the limitation have?
- How many customers are affected?
- Any regulatory or compliance drivers?
- Competitive landscape (do competitors have this)?

**Example:**
```text
**Business Requirements**

**Customer Impact:**
- Blocking adoption for 8 enterprise customers (Fortune 500)
- 3 active support escalations (SEV 2)
- Estimated revenue impact: $2.5M ARR at risk

**Regulatory Drivers:**
- SOC 2 compliance requires organization-issued certificates
- Industry regulations (finance, healthcare) mandate internal CAs

**Business Justification:**
Custom certificate support is table-stakes for enterprise adoption.
Competitors (EKS, AKS) provide this out-of-box. Absence creates
significant competitive disadvantage in enterprise segment.
```

### 4. Affected Packages and Components

**What to include:**
- Which product teams need to be involved?
- What components/operators are affected?
- Any specific technical areas?

**Example:**
```text
**Affected Packages and Components**

* HyperShift / ROSA (hosted control plane team)
* Ingress / Routing (OpenShift networking team)
* Certificate Management (cluster services)
* AWS Integration (cloud provider team)
```

## Customer-Focused Writing

### Be Specific About Customer Need

**Good:**
```text
Customers in regulated industries (finance, healthcare) must use certificates
from their internal CA for audit compliance. Current limitation forces them
to choose between compliance violations or not using ROSA.
```

**Bad:**
```text
We should support custom certificates because it's a best practice.
```

### Include Real Customer Data

**Good:**
```text
Based on 12 customer conversations and 5 support cases:
- 8 customers blocked from purchasing (estimated $2.5M ARR)
- 3 existing customers unable to expand usage
- 2 customers evaluating competitive alternatives
```

**Bad:**
```text
Many customers want this feature.
```

### Link to Supporting Evidence

**Good:**
```text
**Supporting Cases:**
- SFDC Case #01234567: Fortune 100 financial services customer
- SFDC Case #01234568: Healthcare provider with HIPAA requirements
- Support ticket #98765: Government agency compliance issue

**Related Documentation:**
- Enhancement Proposal: https://github.com/org/repo/issues/123
- Customer conversation notes: [internal link]
```

**Bad:**
```text
Customers mentioned this in several calls.
```

## RFE Workflow

### 1. Submission

- Create RFE with complete customer context
- Link to support cases, customer conversations
- Include business justification and impact
- Tag with appropriate components

### 2. Triage

- Product management reviews and prioritizes
- May request additional customer information
- Evaluates against product strategy and roadmap

### 3. Disposition

**Possible outcomes:**

**Accepted → Feature:**
- Approved for roadmap
- Converted to Feature issue
- Scheduled for release

**Accepted → Epic/Story:**
- Smaller request fits in existing work
- Scheduled within current plans

**Deferred:**
- Valid request, not prioritized for current roadmap
- Revisit in future planning cycles

**Declined:**
- Out of scope for product
- Addressed by alternative approach
- Not aligned with product direction

### 4. Communication

- Update RFE with disposition decision
- Notify requesting customer/support engineer
- If accepted, link to Feature/Epic for tracking

## Best Practices

### DO:

✅ **Represent actual customer voice**
- Use direct customer quotes when available
- Include specific customer scenarios
- Reference real support cases

✅ **Provide business context**
- Quantify customer impact (number of customers, revenue)
- Explain business consequences of limitation
- Identify regulatory or compliance drivers

✅ **Be specific about use case**
- Describe exact workflow customer wants to enable
- Explain why current approach doesn't work
- Show concrete examples

✅ **Link supporting evidence**
- SFDC cases, support tickets
- Customer meeting notes
- Enhancement proposals or designs

### DON'T:

❌ **Don't create RFEs for internal ideas**
- Internal engineering improvements → create Task or Epic
- Product strategy initiatives → create Feature
- RFEs are for external customer requests

❌ **Don't propose implementation**
- Focus on customer problem, not solution
- Leave technical approach to engineering
- Describe "what" not "how"

❌ **Don't exaggerate impact**
- Use real data, not speculation
- Avoid terms like "all customers" or "everyone needs"
- Be honest about scope and impact

❌ **Don't skip business justification**
- "Nice to have" is not justification
- Must explain customer impact and business value
- Should quantify impact when possible

## Examples

### Good RFE

**Summary:** Support private link connectivity for ROSA HCP

**Nature and Description:**
- Current Limitation: ROSA HCP requires public internet connectivity
- Desired Behavior: Support AWS PrivateLink for fully private clusters
- Use Case: Customers with strict network isolation policies

**Business Requirements:**
- 12 enterprise customers blocked (estimated $4M ARR)
- Required for FedRAMP compliance
- Competitor Azure has equivalent (Private Link)

**Affected Components:**
- HyperShift / ROSA
- Networking / VPC Integration
- AWS Cloud Provider

### Bad RFE

**Summary:** Make ROSA better

**Nature:** ROSA should have more features.

**Business Requirements:** Customers want improvements.

**Why it's bad:**
- Not specific about what's being requested
- No concrete use case or customer scenario
- No business justification or impact
- Not actionable for product team

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Solution-Focused RFE

**Bad:**
```text
We should implement a new certificate controller that watches a custom CRD
and syncs certificates from AWS Secrets Manager.
```

**Good:**
```text
Customers need to use SSL certificates from their internal CA for compliance.
Current limitation: only Red Hat-issued certificates are supported.
Use case: Enterprise security policies require organization-issued certificates.
```

### ❌ Vague Impact

**Bad:**
```text
This would help a lot of customers and increase adoption.
```

**Good:**
```text
Blocking 8 enterprise deals ($2.5M ARR) and causing 3 active escalations.
Based on field feedback, affects 40% of enterprise evaluation cycles.
```

### ❌ Missing Customer Context

**Bad:**
```text
We should add this feature because it's a gap.
```

**Good:**
```text
SFDC Case #01234567: Fortune 100 customer requires this for SOC 2 compliance.
Customer quote: "Without internal CA support, we cannot use ROSA in production."
Impact: Blocks $500K expansion opportunity.
```

## Summary

RFEs are the mechanism for capturing customer-driven enhancement requests. They focus on customer problems and business justification rather than technical implementation. Effective RFEs include:

- Clear description of customer need and use case
- Specific business impact and justification
- Links to supporting evidence (cases, conversations)
- Identification of affected components

RFEs are evaluated by product management and may become Features, Epics, or Stories depending on scope and strategic fit.

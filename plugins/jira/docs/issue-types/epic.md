# Epic Guide

Guide on Jira Epics: what they are, how to use them, and best practices.

## Usage

```bash
# Create an epic (uses common/epic.yaml template by default)
/jira:create epic OCPBUGS "Multi-cluster metrics aggregation"

# Override with a specific template
/jira:create epic OCPBUGS "Multi-cluster metrics" --template common/epic
```

**Templates:** For more information on templates, see the [Template Guide](../../templates/README.md).

## What is an Epic?

An agile epic is:
- A **body of work** that can be broken down into specific items (stories/tasks)
- Based on the needs/requests of customers or end-users
- An important practice for agile and DevOps teams
- A tool to **manage work** at a higher level than individual stories

### Epic Characteristics

Epics should:
- Be **more narrow** than a market problem or feature
- Be **broader** than a user story
- **Fit inside a time box** (quarter/release)
- Stories within the epic should **fit inside a sprint**
- Include **acceptance criteria** that define when the epic is done

### Epic vs Feature vs Story

| Level | Scope | Duration | Example |
|-------|-------|----------|---------|
| Feature | Strategic objective, market problem | Multiple releases | "Advanced cluster observability" |
| Epic | Specific capability, narrower than feature | One quarter/release | "Multi-cluster metrics aggregation" |
| Story | Single user-facing functionality | One sprint | "As an SRE, I want to view metrics from multiple clusters in one dashboard" |

**When to use each:**
- **Feature**: Strategic initiative spanning multiple quarters, requires multiple epics to deliver
- **Epic**: Specific capability that delivers value but needs multiple stories to implement
- **Story**: Single piece of user-facing functionality that can be completed in one sprint

## Epic Components

### Summary

The epic summary should be:
- **Concise**: 5-10 words max
- **Descriptive**: Clearly states the capability
- **Action-oriented**: Uses verbs when appropriate
- **Specific**: Not vague or generic

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Multi-cluster metrics aggregation for ROSA HCP"
- ✅ "Enable graceful API server responses during maintenance"
- ❌ "Improve monitoring" (too vague)
- ❌ "As an SRE, I want to view metrics..." (that's a story, not an epic)

### Epic Name

**IMPORTANT:** The Epic Name is a separate field from Summary in many Jira configurations.

- Short identifier (3-5 words)
- Displayed in epic picker and boards
- Often set to match or abbreviate the summary
- Missing epic name will cause creation to fail in some projects

**Examples:**
- Summary: "Multi-cluster metrics aggregation for ROSA HCP"
  Epic Name: "Multi-cluster Metrics Aggregation"

- Summary: "Enable graceful API server responses during maintenance"
  Epic Name: "API Graceful Responses"

### Objective

The epic objective should:
- State what capability will be delivered
- Explain why it matters
- Identify who benefits
- Be concise and direct

**Writing Guidelines:**
- **Be concise**: Remove unnecessary adjectives and adverbs
- **Be direct**: State facts, not opinions or emphasis
- **Be specific**: Use concrete nouns and verbs
- **Avoid filler words**: "really", "very", "easily", "simply", "just", "actually", "comprehensive", "powerful"

**Good example (concise, direct):**
```text
Manage hosted control plane clusters from a single dashboard.

Provides metrics aggregation, alerting, and visualization across clusters.
Reduces overhead of managing multiple environments.

Target users: SREs, Platform administrators
```

**Bad example (wordy, with unnecessary modifiers):**
```text
Enable administrators to easily manage multiple hosted control plane clusters
from a single, unified observability dashboard.

This epic will deliver a comprehensive unified metrics aggregation system,
powerful alerting capabilities, and beautiful visualization features across
all clusters, significantly reducing the operational overhead of managing
multiple complex cluster environments.

Target users: SREs, Platform administrators
```

### Acceptance Criteria

Epic-level acceptance criteria define when the epic is complete.

**Characteristics:**
- Broader than story AC (focus on overall capability, not implementation)
- Measurable outcomes
- User-observable (not technical implementation details)
- Typically 3-6 criteria (if more, consider splitting epic)

**Example:**
```text
**Acceptance Criteria**

* Administrators can view aggregated metrics from all clusters in a single dashboard
* Alert rules can be configured to fire based on cross-cluster conditions
* Historical metrics are retained for 30 days across all clusters
* Documentation is complete for multi-cluster setup and configuration
```

**Good AC characteristics:**
- ✅ Focuses on capabilities: "Administrators can..."
- ✅ Measurable: "30 days", "all clusters"
- ✅ User-observable: End users can verify these
- ❌ Not implementation: "Backend uses PostgreSQL" (that's a detail)
- ❌ Not vague: "Epic is done when everything works"

### Scope

Define what is included and excluded:

**In Scope:**
- What functionality is included
- What components are affected
- What scenarios are covered

**Out of Scope:**
- What related work is NOT included
- Future enhancements
- Related but separate efforts

**Example:**
```text
**Scope**

_In Scope_
* Metrics aggregation from multiple ROSA HCP clusters
* Unified dashboard for cluster health and performance
* Cross-cluster alerting capabilities
* 30-day historical metrics retention
* Configuration via CLI and API

_Out of Scope_
* Log aggregation (separate epic PROJ-200)
* Cost reporting (different feature)
* Support for standalone OCP clusters (future consideration)
* Integration with external monitoring systems (post-MVP)
```

**Why scope matters:**
- Prevents scope creep
- Sets clear expectations
- Helps with planning
- Makes it clear what's "not now" vs "never"

### Timeline

Include timeframe information:
- Target quarter or release
- Key milestones (optional)
- Dependencies (optional)
- Known constraints (optional)

**Example:**
```text
**Timeline**

* Target: Q1 2025 / OpenShift 4.21
* Milestone 1: Metrics collection infrastructure (Sprint 1-2)
* Milestone 2: Dashboard and visualization (Sprint 3-4)
* Milestone 3: Alerting and historical data (Sprint 5-6)
```

### Size

Epic size helps with planning and capacity allocation:
- **XS**: About 1 sprint
- **S**: About 2 sprints
- **M**: About 3 sprints (typical)
- **L**: About 4 sprints
- **XL**: About 5 sprints

**Guidelines:**
- If epic is >5 sprints, consider splitting or creating as Feature
- If epic is <1 sprint, consider creating as Story instead
- Size is an estimate, not a commitment

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Objective
State what capability will be delivered and why it matters.

### 2. Define Scope
Explicitly state what's in and out of scope to prevent scope creep.

### 3. Epic Acceptance Criteria
Define high-level outcomes that prove the epic is complete.

### 4. Right Size
Aim for 2-8 sprints. Fits in a quarter but requires multiple stories.

### 5. Timebox
Specify target quarter or release to maintain focus.

### 6. Link to Feature
If part of a larger initiative, link to the parent feature.

### 7. Identify Target Users
Be clear about who benefits from this epic.

### 8. Epic Name Field
Always set the epic name field (often required by Jira).

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Epic is Actually a Story

**Example:**
```text
"As a user, I want to view a dashboard"
```

**Why it's wrong:** Can be completed in one sprint, doesn't need to be broken down.

**Fix:** Create as a Story instead.

---

### ❌ Epic is Actually a Feature

**Example:**
```text
"Complete observability platform redesign" (12 months, 50+ stories)
```

**Why it's wrong:** Too large, spans multiple quarters, strategic in nature.

**Fix:** Create as a Feature with child Epics.

---

### ❌ Vague Acceptance Criteria

**Example:**
```text
* Epic is done when everything works
* All requirements are met
* Team is satisfied
```

**Why it's wrong:** Not measurable, not specific, can't be verified.

**Fix:** Be specific:
```text
* SREs can view metrics from 100+ clusters with <1s load time
* Alert rules fire within 30 seconds of threshold breach
* 99.9% uptime for metrics collection service
```

---

### ❌ Implementation Details in AC

**Example:**
```text
* Backend uses PostgreSQL for metrics storage
* API implements gRPC endpoints
* Frontend uses React components
```

**Why it's wrong:** These are implementation details, not outcomes.

**Fix:** Focus on outcomes:
```text
* Metrics are persisted and queryable for 30 days
* API supports querying metrics for multiple clusters simultaneously
* Dashboard loads cluster data in under 2 seconds
```

---

### ❌ No Scope Definition

**Example:**
```text
Description: "Improve monitoring"
```

**Why it's wrong:** No clarity on what's included or boundaries.

**Fix:** Define what is and isn't included:
```text
_In Scope_
* Real-time cluster health metrics
* Historical data for 30 days
* Cross-cluster alerting

_Out of Scope_
* Log aggregation
* Cost tracking
* Application-level metrics
```

---

### ❌ Epic Has No Stories

**Example:**
An epic that's just a placeholder with no child stories.

**Why it's wrong:** Epics are meant to organize work, not be standalone.

**Fix:** Break down the epic into 3-10 stories that implement the capability.

## Epic Sizing Guide

### Too Small (<1 sprint)
**Symptoms:**
- Can be completed in one sprint
- Only needs 1-2 stories
- Very focused scope

**Action:** Create as a Story instead.

**Example:** "Add a logout button to the dashboard"

---

### Just Right (2-8 sprints)
**Characteristics:**
- Fits in a quarter
- Needs 3-10 stories to complete
- Delivers a cohesive capability
- Has measurable acceptance criteria

**Example:** "Multi-cluster metrics aggregation"

---

### Too Large (>8 sprints)
**Symptoms:**
- Would take more than one quarter
- Needs 20+ stories
- Multiple teams involved
- Strategic in nature

**Action:** Create as a Feature with child Epics, or split into multiple epics.

**Example:** "Complete observability platform redesign"

## Parent Linking

### Epic → Feature

If the epic is part of a larger feature, link it:

**When to link:**
- Epic contributes to a strategic feature
- Feature already exists in Jira
- Epic is one of several needed to complete the feature

**How to link:**
- Use `--parent FEATURE-KEY` when creating
- Or link after creation in Jira UI
- Uses Parent Link field (`customfield_12313140`)

**Example:**
```bash
/jira:create epic CNTRLPLANE "Multi-cluster metrics aggregation" --parent CNTRLPLANE-100
```

### Story/Task → Epic

Stories and tasks link to epics (not covered in this guide - see story.md).

## Examples

### Example 1: Infrastructure Epic

**Summary:** "Centralized metrics storage for ROSA HCP"

**Epic Name:** "Centralized Metrics Storage"

**Objective:**
```text
Provide centralized storage for metrics from all ROSA HCP clusters. Enables
long-term retention and cross-cluster analysis. Supports observability platform.

Target users: SRE teams, Platform administrators
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```text
* Metrics from all ROSA HCP clusters are stored centrally
* Data retained for 90 days with configurable retention policy
* Query performance supports <100ms response for single-cluster queries
* Handles 1M+ metrics per second at peak load
* Backup and recovery procedures documented and tested
```

**Scope:**
```text
_In Scope_
* Metrics collection from ROSA HCP clusters
* Centralized storage infrastructure
* Query API for metrics retrieval
* Data retention policies
* Backup and recovery

_Out of Scope_
* Visualization (separate epic)
* Alerting rules (separate epic)
* Log storage (different system)
* Cost attribution (future work)
```

**Timeline:** Q2 2025, estimate 5 sprints

**Size:** L

### Example 2: Feature Epic

**Summary:** "Self-service cluster upgrade workflow"

**Epic Name:** "Self-Service Upgrades"

**Objective:**
```text
Enable cluster admins to initiate and manage cluster upgrades without SRE
intervention. Reduces support load and improves upgrade adoption.

Target users: Cluster administrators
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```text
* Cluster admins can view available upgrade versions in console
* Upgrade can be scheduled for future time window
* Progress is visible during upgrade
* Rollback available if upgrade fails
* Audit log records all upgrade actions
```

**Scope:**
```text
_In Scope_
* UI for viewing available upgrades
* Scheduling interface
* Progress tracking
* Automated rollback on failure
* Audit logging

_Out of Scope_
* CLI-only upgrades (existing functionality remains)
* Custom upgrade paths (use standard versions only)
* Multi-cluster orchestration (future epic)
```

**Timeline:** Q3 2025, estimate 4 sprints

**Size:** M

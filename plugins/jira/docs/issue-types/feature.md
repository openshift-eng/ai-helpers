## Feature Components

### 1. Summary

Brief description of the strategic objective (5-10 words max)

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Advanced hosted control plane observability"
- ✅ "Multi-cloud cost optimization for hybrid environments"
- ✅ "Edge computing platform for industrial IoT"
- ✅ "Enterprise-grade security and compliance automation"

### 2. Market Problem

**What to include:**
- What customer/business problem does this solve?
- Who is affected by this problem?
- Why is solving this problem important now?
- What happens if we don't solve it?

**Example:**
```text
**Market Problem**

Enterprise customers managing multiple ROSA HCP clusters (50+) face significant
operational challenges:

* Must navigate separate dashboards for each cluster (time-consuming, error-prone)
* Cannot track compliance posture across cluster fleet
* Slow incident detection and response (10-30 minutes to identify cross-cluster issues)
* Difficulty optimizing resources and costs across clusters
* High operational overhead preventing scaling to larger deployments

This problem affects our largest customers and is blocking expansion into enterprise
segments. We've received escalations from 5 strategic accounts, and competitors are
beginning to offer fleet management capabilities, creating competitive pressure.
Without solving this, we risk losing $5M+ in annual renewals and cannot compete
for large enterprise deals.
```

```

## Best Practices

### 1. Strategic Framing

**Always articulate:**
- Market problem (specific customer pain)
- Why solving this matters now
- Business value (not just technical value)
- How this aligns with strategy

**Good example:**
```text
Enterprise customers managing 50+ clusters face operational challenges
that prevent scaling and cause customer escalations. This blocks $5M
in enterprise pipeline and creates competitive risk as competitors
launch fleet management capabilities.
```

**Bad example:**
```text
We need better monitoring.
```

### 2. Measurable Success Criteria

**Define specific metrics across:**
- Adoption (how many, by when)
- Usage (how they use it)
- Outcomes (what improves)
- Business (revenue, cost, satisfaction)

**Good example:**
```text
* Adoption: 50% of enterprise customers within 6 months
* Usage: 10+ daily dashboard views per customer
* Outcomes: 40% faster incident response
* Business: Close 15 blocked deals worth $5M
```

**Bad example:**
```text
* Feature is successful
* Customers are happy
* We make more money
```

### 3. Multi-Epic Scope

**Feature should contain 3-8 epics:**
- Too few (<3): Probably should be an epic
- Just right (3-8): Appropriate feature scope
- Too many (>8): Consider splitting into multiple features

### 4. Customer-Focused Value

**Describe value from customer perspective:**
- What pain is eliminated?
- What becomes possible that wasn't before?
- How does their day-to-day improve?

**Good example:**
```text
SREs managing 100 clusters reduce time on operational tasks from
8 hours/day to 3 hours/day, allowing focus on strategic improvements
instead of firefighting.
```

**Bad example:**
```text
We'll implement a metrics system with APIs and dashboards.
```

### 5. Realistic Timeline

**Features typically:**
- Span 1-3 releases (6-12 months)
- Have clear milestones per quarter
- Account for dependencies and risks
- Include buffer for unknowns

### 6. Risk Awareness

**Identify and address risks:**
- Technical risks (scalability, performance, integration)
- Market risks (competition, customer adoption)
- Execution risks (dependencies, team capacity, timeline)

### 7. Out of Scope Clarity

**Explicitly state what's NOT included:**
- Prevents scope creep
- Sets clear expectations
- Identifies future work
- Helps with prioritization

## Feature Quality Checklist

Before creating a feature, verify:

- ✅ Addresses a real, significant market problem
- ✅ Market problem is specific and well-described
- ✅ Strategic value clearly articulated
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable (not vague)
- ✅ Contains 3-8 epics (multi-epic scope)
- ✅ Timeline is realistic (1-3 releases)
- ✅ Aligns with product strategy
- ✅ Customer value is clear
- ✅ Business impact is quantified
- ✅ Out of scope is defined
- ✅ No sensitive data (if public project)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Feature is Actually an Epic

**Example:**
```text
Feature: "Multi-cluster dashboard"
Scope: Single dashboard, 1 epic, 2 months
```

**Why bad:** Too small, single capability, should be an epic

**Fix:** Create as Epic instead, or expand scope to include related capabilities
```text
Epic: "Multi-cluster dashboard"
OR
Feature: "Advanced multi-cluster observability" (contains dashboard + alerting + reporting + API)
```

---

### ❌ No Strategic Context

**Example:**
```text
Feature: "Build monitoring system"
Description: We need to build a monitoring system.
```

**Why bad:** No market problem, no business value, no strategic framing

**Fix:** Articulate the market problem and strategic value
```text
Feature: "Enterprise-grade hosted control plane observability"
Market Problem: Enterprise customers managing 50+ clusters face...
Strategic Value: Unblocks $5M pipeline, competitive differentiator...
```

---

### ❌ Vague Success Criteria

**Example:**
```text
Success Criteria:
* Feature is successful
* Customers like it
* We make more money
* Product improves
```

**Why bad:** Not measurable, can't determine success, no accountability

**Fix:** Use specific, measurable metrics
```text
Success Criteria:
* Adoption: 50% of enterprise customers (100+ users) within 6 months
* Usage: 80% daily active usage by SREs
* Outcomes: 40% faster incident response (measured via support metrics)
* Business: $5M in closed deals, $250K support cost reduction
```

---

### ❌ Technical Implementation as Feature

**Example:**
```text
Feature: "Migrate to Kubernetes operator pattern"
Feature: "Upgrade to etcd v3.6"
Feature: "Refactor authentication service"
```

**Why bad:** These are technical implementation details, not customer-facing value

**Fix:** Features describe customer value; technical work is epics/tasks
```text
Epic: "Migrate to Kubernetes operator pattern" (enables better automation)
OR
Feature: "Simplified cluster lifecycle management" (customer value)
  ↳ Epic: Migration to operator pattern (technical enabler)
```

---

### ❌ No Epic Breakdown

**Example:**
```text
Feature: "Advanced observability"
Scope: <vague description>
Epics: <none identified>
```

**Why bad:** Can't plan, can't estimate, can't track progress

**Fix:** Identify 3-8 major epics
```text
Feature: "Advanced observability"
Epics:
* Epic 1: Metrics aggregation infrastructure
* Epic 2: Unified dashboard
* Epic 3: Fleet-wide alerting
* Epic 4: Compliance reporting
* Epic 5: API and CLI
* Epic 6: Tool integrations
* Epic 7: Documentation and enablement
```

---

### ❌ Missing Business Impact

**Example:**
```text
Feature: "Multi-cluster observability"
Value: It would be nice to have this.
```

**Why bad:** No justification for investment, unclear ROI

**Fix:** Quantify business impact
```text
Business Impact:
* Unblocks $5M in enterprise pipeline (15 deals waiting for this)
* Reduces support costs by $250K annually
* Competitive differentiator (no competitor offers this)
* Improves enterprise retention by 15% ($1.2M value)
```

---

### ❌ Unrealistic Timeline

**Example:**
```text
Feature: "Complete platform rewrite"
Timeline: 1 month
Epics: 25 epics
```

**Why bad:** Impossible to deliver, sets false expectations

**Fix:** Realistic timeline based on scope
```text
Feature: "Incremental platform modernization"
Timeline: 12 months (4 releases)
Epics: 8 focused epics delivered incrementally
```

### Example 2: Platform Feature

**Summary:** "Edge computing platform for industrial IoT workloads"

**Description:**
```text
Enable customers to deploy and manage containerized workloads on resource-constrained
edge devices in industrial environments, supporting use cases like manufacturing
automation, predictive maintenance, and real-time quality control.

**Market Problem**

Industrial customers ($800B market) need to run intelligent workloads (ML inference,
real-time analytics) at the edge for latency-sensitive use cases:

* Manufacturing: Real-time quality inspection (requires <50ms latency)
* Energy: Predictive maintenance on equipment (prevents $2M+ outages)
* Retail: In-store personalization and inventory management
* Transportation: Autonomous vehicle coordination

Current solutions force a choice:
* Cloud-only: Too much latency (200-500ms) for real-time use cases
* On-prem VMs: High cost, complexity, no container benefits
* DIY edge: No standard platform, high operational burden

This is a greenfield market where we have no offering. Competitors (AWS Greengrass,
Azure IoT Edge) are gaining traction, capturing market share we could win.

**Proposed Solution**

Build an edge computing platform based on MicroShift that enables:

* Lightweight container runtime for resource-constrained devices (2 CPU, 4GB RAM)

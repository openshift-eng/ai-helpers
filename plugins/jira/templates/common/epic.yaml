  - name: objective
    description: "Epic objective describing the capability"
    required: true
    type: multiline
    prompt_text: "What is the main objective or goal of this epic? What capability will it deliver?"
    help_text: |
      State what capability will be delivered and why it matters.
      Be concise - remove unnecessary adjectives and adverbs.
      Focus on the value delivered, not implementation details.
    examples:
      - "Enable SREs to manage multiple ROSA HCP clusters from a unified observability dashboard, reducing operational complexity."
      - "Provide graceful API server responses during planned maintenance by writing expected downtime information to disk."

  - name: acceptance_criteria
    description: "High-level outcomes that define epic completion (one per line)"

    help_text: |
      Epic acceptance criteria are high-level outcomes, not implementation details.
      Focus on capabilities that must exist when the epic is done.
      Should be measurable and demonstrable.
      Typically 3-6 criteria.
    examples:
      - "Administrators can view aggregated metrics from all clusters in a single dashboard"
      - "Alert rules can be configured to fire based on cross-cluster conditions"
      - "Historical metrics are retained for 30 days across all clusters"

  - name: in_scope

      Be specific about features, components, and scenarios covered.

    required: false
    type: list
    prompt_text: "What related work is explicitly out of scope? (optional)"
    default: []
    help_text: |
      Clarify boundaries by stating what is NOT included.

      Size helps with capacity planning and sprint allocation.
      Based on estimated number of sprints to complete.
      If epic is >5 sprints, consider splitting or creating as Feature.
      If epic is <1 sprint, consider creating as Story instead.

# Create Jira Story

This skill provides implementation guidance for creating well-structured Jira user stories following agile best practices, including proper user story format and comprehensive acceptance criteria.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill is automatically invoked by the `/jira:create story` command to guide the story creation process.

## Prerequisites

- MCP Jira server configured and accessible
- User has permissions to create issues in the target project
- Understanding of the user story and acceptance criteria to be created

## User Story Best Practices

### What is a User Story?

A user story:
- Describes product functionality from a customer's perspective
- Is a collaboration tool - a reminder to have a conversation
- Shifts focus from writing documentation to talking with stakeholders
- Describes concrete business scenarios in shared language
- Is the right size for planning - level of detail based on implementation horizon

### The 3 Cs of User Stories

Every user story should have three components:

1. **Card** - The story itself (As a... I want... So that...)
2. **Conversation** - Discussion between team and stakeholders about implementation
3. **Confirmation** - Acceptance criteria that define "done"

## User Story Template

### Standard Format

```
As a <User/Who>, I want to <Action/What>, so that <Purpose/Why>.
```

**Components:**

- **Who (User/Role):** The person, device, or system that will benefit from or use the output
  - Examples: "cluster admin", "developer", "end user", "monitoring system", "CI pipeline"

- **What (Action):** What they can do with the system
  - Examples: "configure automatic scaling", "view cluster metrics", "deploy applications"

- **Why (Purpose):** Why they want to do the activity, the value they gain
  - Examples: "to handle traffic spikes", "to identify performance issues", "to reduce deployment time"

### Good Examples

```
As a cluster admin, I want to configure automatic node pool scaling based on CPU utilization, so that I can handle traffic spikes without manual intervention.
```

```
As a developer, I want to view real-time cluster metrics in the web console, so that I can quickly identify performance issues before they impact users.
```

```
As an SRE, I want to set up alerting rules for control plane health, so that I can be notified immediately when issues occur.
```

### Bad Examples (and why)

❌ "Add scaling feature"
- **Why bad:** No user, no value statement, too vague

❌ "As a user, I want better performance"
- **Why bad:** Not actionable, no specific action, unclear benefit

❌ "Implement autoscaling API"
- **Why bad:** Technical task, not user-facing value

✅ **Convert to:** "As a cluster admin, I want to configure autoscaling policies via the API, so that I can automate cluster capacity management"

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria:
- Express conditions that need to be satisfied for the customer
- Provide context and details for the team
- Help the team know when they are done
- Provide testing point of view
- Are written by Product Owner or dev team members
- Are refined during backlog grooming and iteration planning

### Formats for Acceptance Criteria

Choose the format that best fits the story:

#### Format 1: Test-Based
```
- Test that <criteria>
```

**Example:**
```
- Test that node pools scale up when CPU exceeds 80%
- Test that node pools scale down when CPU drops below 30%
- Test that scaling respects configured min/max node limits
```

#### Format 2: Demonstration-Based
```
- Demonstrate that <this happens>
```

**Example:**
```
- Demonstrate that scaling policies can be configured via CLI
- Demonstrate that scaling events appear in the audit log
- Demonstrate that users receive notifications when scaling occurs
```

#### Format 3: Verification-Based
```
- Verify that when <a role> does <some action> they get <this result>
```

**Example:**
```
- Verify that when a cluster admin sets max nodes to 10, the node pool never exceeds 10 nodes
- Verify that when scaling is disabled, node count remains constant regardless of load
```

#### Format 4: Given-When-Then (BDD)
```
- Given <a context> when <this event occurs> then <this happens>
```

**Example:**
```
- Given CPU utilization is at 85%, when the scaling policy is active, then a new node is provisioned within 2 minutes
- Given the node pool is at maximum capacity, when scaling is triggered, then an alert is raised and no nodes are added
```

### How Much Acceptance Criteria is Enough?

You have enough AC when:
- ✅ You have enough to size/estimate the story
- ✅ The testing approach is clear but not convoluted
- ✅ You've made 2-3 revisions of the criteria
- ✅ The story is independently testable

**If you need more AC:**
- Consider splitting the story into multiple smaller stories
- Each story should be completable in one sprint

**If AC is too detailed:**
- Move implementation details to subtasks or technical design docs
- Keep AC focused on user-observable behavior

## Interactive Story Collection Workflow

When creating a story, guide the user through the process:

### 1. Collect User Story Statement

**Prompt:** "Let's create the user story. I can help you format it properly."

**Ask three questions:**

1. **Who benefits?**
   ```
   Who is the user or role that will benefit from this feature?
   Examples: cluster admin, developer, SRE, end user, system administrator
   ```

2. **What action?**
   ```
   What do they want to be able to do?
   Examples: configure autoscaling, view metrics, set up alerts
   ```

3. **What value/why?**
   ```
   Why do they want this? What value does it provide?
   Examples: to handle traffic spikes, to improve visibility, to reduce downtime
   ```

**Construct the story:**
```
As a <answer1>, I want to <answer2>, so that <answer3>.
```

**Present to user and ask for confirmation:**
```
Here's the user story:

As a cluster admin, I want to configure automatic node pool scaling, so that I can handle traffic spikes without manual intervention.

Does this look correct? (yes/no/modify)
```

### 2. Collect Acceptance Criteria

**Prompt:** "Now let's define the acceptance criteria. These help the team know when the story is complete."

**Approach 1: Guided Questions**

Ask probing questions:
```
1. What are the key behaviors that must work?
2. What are the edge cases or boundaries?
3. How will this be tested?
4. What shouldn't happen?
```

**Approach 2: Template Assistance**

Offer format templates:
```
Which format would you like to use for acceptance criteria?
1. Test that... (test-based)
2. Verify that when... they get... (verification-based)
3. Given... when... then... (BDD)
4. I'll write them in my own format
```

**Approach 3: Free-Form**

```
Please provide the acceptance criteria (one per line, or I can help you structure them):
```

**Validate AC:**
- At least 2-3 criteria provided
- Criteria are specific and testable
- Criteria cover happy path and edge cases
- Criteria are user-observable (not implementation details)

### 3. Collect Additional Context (Optional)

**Prompt:** "Any additional context for the team? (Optional)"

**Helpful additions:**
- Background: Why is this needed now?
- Dependencies: What must exist before this can be done?
- Constraints: Any technical or business constraints?
- Out of scope: What is explicitly not included?
- References: Links to designs, docs, related issues

**Example:**
```
Additional Context:
- This builds on the existing monitoring infrastructure introduced in PROJ-100
- Must integrate with Prometheus metrics
- Out of scope: Custom metrics (will be separate story)
- Design doc: https://docs.example.com/autoscaling-design
```

## Story Sizing and Splitting

### Right-Sized Stories

A well-sized story:
- Can be completed in one sprint (typically 1-2 weeks)
- Can be demonstrated as working software
- Delivers incremental value
- Has clear acceptance criteria

### When to Split Stories

Split a story if:
- It would take more than one sprint
- It has too many acceptance criteria (>7-8)
- It contains multiple distinct features
- It has hard dependencies that could be separate
- Testing becomes too complex

### Splitting Techniques

**By workflow steps:**
```
Original: As a user, I want to manage my account settings
Split:
- As a user, I want to view my account settings
- As a user, I want to update my account settings
- As a user, I want to delete my account
```

**By acceptance criteria:**
```
Original: Complex story with 10 AC
Split:
- Story 1: AC 1-4 (core functionality)
- Story 2: AC 5-7 (edge cases)
- Story 3: AC 8-10 (advanced features)
```

**By platform/component:**
```
Original: Add feature to all platforms
Split:
- Add feature to web interface
- Add feature to CLI
- Add feature to API
```

## Field Validation

Before submitting the story, validate:

### Required Fields
- ✅ Summary is clear and concise
- ✅ Description contains user story in proper format
- ✅ Acceptance criteria are present (at least 2)
- ✅ Component is specified (if required by project)
- ✅ Target version is set (if required by project)

### Story Quality
- ✅ Story follows "As a... I want... So that..." format
- ✅ Story describes user-facing value (not implementation)
- ✅ Acceptance criteria are testable
- ✅ Acceptance criteria are specific (not vague)
- ✅ Story is sized appropriately (can fit in one sprint)

### Security
- ✅ No credentials, API keys, or secrets in any field
- ✅ No sensitive customer data in examples

```

## Error Handling

### Invalid Story Format

**Scenario:** User provides a story that doesn't follow the template.

**Action:**
1. Identify the issue (missing "Who", "What", or "Why")
2. Explain the user story format
3. Ask questions to extract missing components
4. Reconstruct the story properly

**Example:**
```
The story "Add autoscaling" doesn't follow the user story format.

Let me help you structure it:
- Who will use this feature? (e.g., cluster admin, developer)
- What do they want to do? (e.g., configure autoscaling)
- Why do they want it? (e.g., to handle traffic spikes)
```

### Missing Acceptance Criteria

**Scenario:** User doesn't provide acceptance criteria.

**Action:**
1. Explain importance of AC
2. Offer to help create them
3. Ask probing questions about expected behavior
4. Suggest format that fits the story

**Example:**
```
Acceptance criteria help define when this story is complete. Let's add some.

What are the key behaviors that must work for this story?
For example:
- What actions should users be able to perform?
- What should happen in edge cases?
- How will you know the feature works correctly?
```

### Story Too Large

**Scenario:** Story has too many acceptance criteria or sounds too complex.

**Action:**
1. Suggest the story might be too large for one sprint
2. Identify potential split points
3. Offer to create multiple stories
4. Create parent epic if multiple related stories

**Example:**
```
This story has 12 acceptance criteria, which suggests it might be too large for one sprint.

I can help split this into smaller stories:
1. Core functionality (AC 1-4)
2. Advanced features (AC 5-8)
3. Edge cases and validation (AC 9-12)

Would you like me to create these as separate stories under an epic?
```

### Vague Acceptance Criteria

**Scenario:** AC is too vague or not testable.

**Action:**
1. Identify vague criteria
2. Ask for specifics
3. Suggest more concrete phrasing

**Example:**
```
This acceptance criteria is a bit vague: "Test that it works well"

Can you be more specific? For example:
- What does "works well" mean? (fast response time? handles errors?)
- How would you test this? (what specific behavior would you verify?)

Suggested revision: "Verify that API response time is under 100ms for 95% of requests"
```

### Security Validation Failure

**Scenario:** Sensitive data detected in story content.

**Action:**
1. STOP submission
2. Inform user what type of data was detected
3. Ask for redaction or placeholder values

**Example:**
```
I detected what appears to be API credentials in the acceptance criteria.
Please use placeholder values like "YOUR_API_KEY" instead of real credentials.
```

### MCP Tool Error

**Scenario:** MCP tool returns an error when creating the story.

**Action:**
1. Parse error message
2. Provide user-friendly explanation
3. Suggest corrective action
4. Offer to retry

**Common errors:**
- **"Field 'parent' does not exist"** → Remove parent link or verify epic exists
- **"Invalid issue type"** → Verify project supports "Story" issue type
- **"Component not found"** → List available components, ask user to select

## Examples

### Example 1: Interactive Story Creation

**Input:**
```bash
/jira:create story MYPROJECT "Add user dashboard"
```

**Conversation:**
```
Let's create the user story. I'll ask a few questions:

Who is the user or role that will benefit from this feature?
> End users

What do they want to be able to do?
> View their activity dashboard with recent actions and notifications

Why do they want this? What value does it provide?
> To quickly see what's happened in their account without navigating multiple pages

Great! Here's the user story:

As an end user, I want to view my activity dashboard with recent actions and notifications, so that I can quickly see what's happened in my account without navigating multiple pages.

Does this look correct?
> Yes

Now let's define acceptance criteria. What are the key behaviors that must work?
> 1. Dashboard shows last 10 actions
> 2. Dashboard shows unread notifications
> 3. Dashboard updates in real-time
> 4. Users can filter by action type

Excellent. I'll format these as test-based criteria:

* Test that dashboard displays the last 10 user actions
* Test that dashboard displays all unread notifications
* Test that dashboard updates in real-time when new actions occur
* Verify that users can filter actions by type (login, purchase, settings change)

Any additional context?
> This is part of the Q1 user experience improvements

Perfect! Creating the story now...
```

**Result:**
```
Created: MYPROJECT-123
Title: Add user dashboard
URL: https://jira.example.com/browse/MYPROJECT-123
```

### Example 2: Story with Auto-Detection (CNTRLPLANE)

**Input:**
```bash
/jira:create story CNTRLPLANE "Enable pod disruption budgets for ROSA HCP control plane"
```

**Auto-applied (via cntrlplane skill):**
- Component: HyperShift / ROSA (detected from "ROSA HCP")
- Target Version: openshift-4.21
- Labels: ai-generated-jira
- Security: Red Hat Employee

**Interactive prompts:**
- User story format (Who/What/Why)
- Acceptance criteria

**Result:**
- Full story created with CNTRLPLANE conventions

### Example 3: Story with Parent Epic

**Input:**
```bash
/jira:create story CNTRLPLANE "Add scaling metrics to observability dashboard" --parent CNTRLPLANE-100
```

**Result:**
- Story created
- Linked to epic CNTRLPLANE-100
- All standard fields applied

## Best Practices Summary

1. **User-focused:** Always describe value from user perspective
2. **Specific actions:** Clear what the user can do
3. **Clear value:** Explicit why (benefit to user)
4. **Testable AC:** Specific, observable criteria
5. **Right-sized:** Can complete in one sprint
6. **Conversational:** Story prompts discussion, not full spec
7. **Independent:** Story can be implemented standalone
8. **Valuable:** Delivers user value when complete

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Technical tasks disguised as stories**
```
As a developer, I want to refactor the database layer
```
✅ Use a Task instead, or reframe with user value

❌ **Too many stories in one**
```
As a user, I want to create, edit, delete, and share documents
```
✅ Split into 4 separate stories

❌ **Vague acceptance criteria**
```
- Test that it works correctly
- Verify good performance
```
✅ Be specific: "Response time under 200ms", "Handles 1000 concurrent users"

❌ **Implementation details in AC**
```
- Test that the function uses Redis cache
- Verify that the API calls the UserService.get() method
```
✅ Focus on user-observable behavior, not implementation

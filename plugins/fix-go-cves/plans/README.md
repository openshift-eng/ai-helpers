# Fix Go CVEs work plans

Acceptance remains **open**. Seven earlier pilots and C8/C9 remain separate
stopped campaigns; C8's 005 passed individually, while C9's single 007 failed
factual review despite correct operations and advice. Original artifacts and
grades remain intact. The current skill quotes observations, then gives
only future actions. Current component verification passes, including frozen
shell/Python integration and focused Unicode boundary controls. The [results record](../evals/implementation-results.md)
owns counts and source identities. No actor has measured this source. C10 starts
with 007 and requires complete stock stages and independent review per cell.

| Document | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| [E2E plan](e2e-simplification.md) | Implemented design, remaining acceptance sequence and conditional simplifications |
| [Testing strategy](testing.md) | Durable runtime, behavioral, calibration and evidence-reuse requirements |
| [Implementation results](../evals/implementation-results.md) | Measured outcomes, source groups and grader disagreements |
| [Workqueue investigation](workqueue-race.md) | External race evidence, inconclusive diagnostic patch and preferred cleanup design |
| [Eval README](../evals/README.md) | Setup, commands and case map |
| [Historical live record](../evals/live/README.md#branch-policy-matrix) | Original matrices, grades, costs and coverage limits |

## Deferred work

- **Measured deletions:** remove reviewers/repeated scans only after their gate
  semantics and observed source/binary/policy states are accounted for. Deduplicate
  tuple/location parsing after semantic parity, preserving distinct gate meanings.
- **Workspace features:** add `go work vendor` or stdlib repair through `go.work`
  for a concrete target need. Existing workspace synchronization remains confined
  to owned transaction members.
- **OpenShift/custom compilers:** require actual compiler evidence and repository
  policy; image tags or a Go minor alone do not prove a patched build.
- **Operational classification:** check both test attempts for disk exhaustion;
  distinguish noninteractive authentication failures using the existing test
  command remedy. No generic prompt detector or predictive disk monitor.
- **Shipyard synchronization:** after acceptance, port relevant changes or point
  its CVE workflow at this plugin rather than maintaining divergent copies.

The E2E plan retains the bounded source-coverage question and broader exclusions.
Keep unique historical evidence where recorded; documentation simplification must
preserve failures and all runtime, policy, native and publication requirements.

# Must-Gather Analyzer Skill

Comprehensive analysis of OpenShift must-gather diagnostic data with helper scripts that parse YAML and display output in `oc`-like format.

## Overview

This skill provides analysis for:
- **ClusterVersion**: Current version, update status, and capabilities
- **Cluster Operators**: Status, degradation, and availability
- **Pods**: Health, restarts, crashes, and failures across namespaces
- **Nodes**: Conditions, capacity, and readiness
- **Network**: OVN/SDN diagnostics and connectivity
- **Events**: Warning and error events across namespaces
- **etcd**: Cluster health, member status, and quorum
- **Storage**: PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims status

## Must-Gather Directory Structure

**Important**: Must-gather data is contained in a subdirectory with a long hash name:
```
must-gather/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ registry-ci-openshift-org-origin-...-sha256-<hash>/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cluster-scoped-resources/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.openshift.io/clusteroperators/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ core/nodes/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ namespaces/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <namespace>/
    ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pods/
    ‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <pod-name>/
    ‚îÇ               ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <pod-name>.yaml
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ network_logs/
```

The analysis scripts expect the path to the **subdirectory** (the one with the hash), not the root must-gather folder.

## Instructions

### 1. Get Must-Gather Path
Ask the user for the must-gather directory path if not already provided.
- If they provide the root directory, look for the subdirectory with the hash name
- The correct path contains `cluster-scoped-resources/` and `namespaces/` directories

### 2. Choose Analysis Type

Based on user's request, run the appropriate helper script:

#### ClusterVersion Analysis
```bash
./scripts/analyze_clusterversion.py <must-gather-path>
```

Shows cluster version information similar to `oc get clusterversion`:
- Current version and update status
- Progressing state
- Available updates
- Version conditions
- Enabled capabilities
- Update history

#### Cluster Operators Analysis
```bash
./scripts/analyze_clusteroperators.py <must-gather-path>
```

Shows cluster operator status similar to `oc get clusteroperators`:
- Available, Progressing, Degraded conditions
- Version information
- Time since condition change
- Detailed messages for operators with issues

#### Pods Analysis
```bash
# All namespaces
./scripts/analyze_pods.py <must-gather-path>

# Specific namespace
./scripts/analyze_pods.py <must-gather-path> --namespace <namespace>

# Show only problematic pods
./scripts/analyze_pods.py <must-gather-path> --problems-only
```

Shows pod status similar to `oc get pods -A`:
- Ready/Total containers
- Status (Running, Pending, CrashLoopBackOff, etc.)
- Restart counts
- Age
- Categorized issues (crashlooping, pending, failed)

#### Nodes Analysis
```bash
./scripts/analyze_nodes.py <must-gather-path>

# Show only nodes with issues
./scripts/analyze_nodes.py <must-gather-path> --problems-only
```

Shows node status similar to `oc get nodes`:
- Ready status
- Roles (master, worker)
- Age
- Kubernetes version
- Node conditions (DiskPressure, MemoryPressure, etc.)
- Capacity and allocatable resources

#### Network Analysis
```bash
./scripts/analyze_network.py <must-gather-path>
```

Shows network health:
- Network type (OVN-Kubernetes, OpenShift SDN)
- Network operator status
- OVN pod health
- PodNetworkConnectivityCheck results
- Network-related issues

#### Events Analysis
```bash
# Recent events (last 100)
./scripts/analyze_events.py <must-gather-path>

# Warning events only
./scripts/analyze_events.py <must-gather-path> --type Warning

# Events in specific namespace
./scripts/analyze_events.py <must-gather-path> --namespace openshift-etcd

# Show last 50 events
./scripts/analyze_events.py <must-gather-path> --count 50
```

Shows cluster events:
- Event type (Warning, Normal)
- Last seen timestamp
- Reason and message
- Affected object
- Event count

#### etcd Analysis
```bash
./scripts/analyze_etcd.py <must-gather-path>
```

Shows etcd cluster health:
- Member health status
- Member list with IDs and URLs
- Endpoint status (leader, version, DB size)
- Quorum status
- Cluster summary

#### Storage Analysis
```bash
# All PVs and PVCs
./scripts/analyze_pvs.py <must-gather-path>

# PVCs in specific namespace
./scripts/analyze_pvs.py <must-gather-path> --namespace openshift-monitoring
```

Shows storage resources:
- PersistentVolumes (capacity, status, claims)
- PersistentVolumeClaims (binding, capacity)
- Storage classes
- Pending/unbound volumes

### 3. Interpret and Report

After running the scripts:
1. Review the summary statistics
2. Focus on items flagged with issues
3. Provide actionable insights and next steps
4. Suggest log analysis for specific components if needed
5. Cross-reference issues (e.g., degraded operator ‚Üí failing pods ‚Üí node issues)

## Output Format

All scripts provide:
- **Summary Section**: High-level statistics with emoji indicators
- **Table View**: `oc`-like formatted output
- **Issues Section**: Detailed breakdown of problems

Example summary format:
```
================================================================================
SUMMARY: 25/28 operators healthy
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  3 operators with issues
  üîÑ 1 progressing
  ‚ùå 2 degraded
================================================================================
```

## Tips for Analysis

1. **Start with Cluster Operators**: They often reveal system-wide issues
2. **Check Timing**: Look at "SINCE" columns to understand when issues started
3. **Follow Dependencies**: Degraded operator ‚Üí check its namespace pods ‚Üí check hosting nodes
4. **Look for Patterns**: Multiple pods failing on same node suggests node issue
5. **Cross-reference**: Use multiple scripts together for complete picture

## Common Scenarios

### "Why is my cluster degraded?"
1. Run `analyze_clusteroperators.py` - identify degraded operators
2. Run `analyze_pods.py --namespace <operator-namespace>` - check operator pods
3. Run `analyze_nodes.py` - verify node health

### "Pods keep crashing"
1. Run `analyze_pods.py --problems-only` - find crashlooping pods
2. Check which nodes they're on
3. Run `analyze_nodes.py` - verify node conditions
4. Suggest checking pod logs in must-gather data

### "Network connectivity issues"
1. Run `analyze_network.py` - check network health
2. Run `analyze_pods.py --namespace openshift-ovn-kubernetes`
3. Check PodNetworkConnectivityCheck results

## Next Steps After Analysis

Based on findings, suggest:
- Examining specific pod logs in `namespaces/<ns>/pods/<pod>/<container>/logs/`
- Reviewing events in `namespaces/<ns>/core/events.yaml`
- Checking audit logs in `audit_logs/`
- Analyzing metrics data if available
- Looking at host service logs in `host_service_logs/`

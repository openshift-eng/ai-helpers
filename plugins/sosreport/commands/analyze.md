  - CPU information and load averages
  - Disk usage and filesystem capacity
  - Top resource consumers and zombie processes

- **`network`**: Analyze network configuration and connectivity
  - Network interface status and IP addresses
  - Routing table and default gateway

  - SELinux/AppArmor configuration and denials
  - Kernel parameters and resource limits

## Description
The `sosreport:analyze` command performs comprehensive analysis of a sosreport archive (from https://github.com/sosreport/sos) to identify system issues, configuration problems, and potential causes of failures. It examines system logs, resource usage, network configuration, installed packages, and other diagnostic data collected by sosreport.

By default, all analysis areas are executed. Use `--only` to run specific areas or `--skip` to exclude areas from analysis.

## Arguments
- `$1` (required): Path to the sosreport archive file (`.tar.gz` or `.tar.xz`) or extracted directory
- `--only <areas>` (optional): Comma-separated list of analysis areas to run. Valid areas: `logs`, `resources`, `network`, `system-config`. If not specified, all areas are analyzed.
- `--skip <areas>` (optional): Comma-separated list of analysis areas to skip. Valid areas: `logs`, `resources`, `network`, `system-config`. Cannot be used with `--only`.

## Implementation

The sosreport analysis is organized into several specialized phases, each with detailed implementation guidance in separate skill documents. The command supports selective analysis through optional arguments.

### 1. Parse Arguments and Determine Analysis Scope

1. **Parse command-line arguments**
   - Extract the sosreport path (required first argument)
   - Check for `--only` flag and parse comma-separated areas
   - Check for `--skip` flag and parse comma-separated areas
   - Validate that `--only` and `--skip` are not used together

2. **Validate analysis areas**
   - Valid areas: `logs`, `resources`, `network`, `system-config`
   - If invalid area specified, return error with list of valid areas
   - Normalize area names (case-insensitive, accept variations like `system` for `system-config`)

3. **Determine which skills to run**
   - If no flags specified: Run all skills (default comprehensive analysis)
   - If `--only` specified: Run only the specified skills
   - If `--skip` specified: Run all skills except the specified ones
   - Store the list of skills to execute for later phases

4. **Example argument parsing**:
   ```bash
   # Parse: /sosreport:analyze /path/sos.tar.gz --only logs,network
   # Result: Run only logs-analysis and network-analysis skills

   # Parse: /sosreport:analyze /path/sos.tar.gz --skip resources
   # Result: Run logs, network, and system-config (skip resources)

   # Parse: /sosreport:analyze /path/sos.tar.gz
   # Result: Run all skills (comprehensive analysis)
   ```

### 2. Extract and Validate Sosreport

1. **Check if path exists**
   - Verify the provided path points to a valid file or directory
   - If file doesn't exist, return error with helpful message

2. **Extract archive if needed**
   - If path is a `.tar.gz` or `.tar.xz` file:
     - Create extraction directory: `.work/sosreport-analyze/{timestamp}/`
     - Extract archive: `tar -xf <path> -C .work/sosreport-analyze/{timestamp}/`
     - Store extracted directory path for analysis
   - If path is already a directory:
     - Verify it's a valid sosreport directory (check for `sos_commands/`, `sos_logs/`, etc.)
     - Use the directory directly

3. **Identify sosreport structure**
   - Locate the root directory (usually has format `sosreport-{hostname}-{date}/`)
   - Verify expected directories exist: `sos_commands/`, `sos_logs/`, `sos_reports/`

### 3. Analyze System Logs

### 6. Analyze Installed Packages and System Configuration

**Run condition**: Only if `system-config` area is selected (or no filters specified)
**Detailed implementation**: See `plugins/sosreport/skills/system-config-analysis/SKILL.md`

Perform system configuration analysis including:
- OS version and kernel information
- Installed package versions
- Systemd service status
- Failed services with reasons
- SELinux/AppArmor configuration and denials
- Kernel parameters and resource limits

**Key outputs**:
- System information summary

### 7. Generate Interactive Summary

1. **Create findings structure**
   - Organize findings by category (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info)
   - Include only findings from the selected analysis areas
   - For each finding, include:
     - Severity level
     - Category (logs, resources, network, packages, config)
     - Description of the issue
     - Evidence (file paths, log snippets, metrics)
     - Recommended actions

2. **Display summary in terminal**
   - Show executive summary with key statistics
   - List critical and high-severity findings
   - Provide file paths for detailed investigation
   - Include timeline of significant events
   - Suggest next steps for troubleshooting

3. **Format output**
   ```

## Return Value

- **Format**: Interactive summary displayed in terminal with categorized findings
- **Exit code**:

## Examples

1. **Comprehensive analysis (default)**:
   ```
   /sosreport:analyze /tmp/sosreport-server01-2024-01-15.tar.xz
   ```

   Extracts archive to `.work/sosreport-analyze/{timestamp}/` and performs comprehensive analysis using all skills (logs, resources, network, system-config).

2. **Analyze only logs and network**:
   ```
   /sosreport:analyze /tmp/sosreport-server01-2024-01-15.tar.xz --only logs,network
   ```

   Performs only log analysis and network analysis. Useful when investigating connectivity or service issues without needing full resource analysis.

3. **Skip resource analysis**:
   ```
   /sosreport:analyze /tmp/sosreport.tar.gz --skip resources
   ```

   Performs all analysis except resource analysis. Useful when you already know resource metrics and want to focus on configuration and logs.

4. **Quick log-only analysis**:
   ```
   /sosreport:analyze /tmp/sosreport.tar.xz --only logs
   ```

   Performs only log analysis. Fastest option for quickly identifying errors and critical events without analyzing configuration or resources.

5. **Analyze extracted sosreport directory**:
   ```
   /sosreport:analyze /tmp/sosreport-server01-2024-01-15/
   ```

   Analyzes an already extracted sosreport directory with comprehensive analysis.

6. **Selective analysis on extracted directory**:
   ```
   /sosreport:analyze /tmp/sosreport-server01-2024-01-15/ --only system-config,network
   ```

   Analyzes only system configuration and network from an already extracted directory.

7. **Follow-up investigation**:
   ```
   User: /sosreport:analyze /tmp/sosreport.tar.gz --only logs
   Agent: [Shows log analysis summary]
   User: Can you now analyze the resources as well?
   Agent: /sosreport:analyze /tmp/sosreport.tar.gz --only resources
   Agent: [Shows resource analysis]
   ```

## Notes

- Sosreport structure varies by OS version and sosreport version
- Command handles both compressed archives and extracted directories
- Analysis focuses on common issues but can be extended for specific use cases
- For OpenShift/Kubernetes sosreports, additional pod/container analysis may be relevant
- Large sosreports (>1GB) may take several minutes to analyze
- **Selective analysis**: Use `--only` or `--skip` to run specific analysis areas for faster results
- **Performance**: Running only needed analysis areas reduces analysis time significantly
- **Valid areas**: `logs`, `resources`, `network`, `system-config`

## Prerequisites

1. **tar utility**: Required for extracting compressed sosreports
   - Check: `which tar`
   - Usually pre-installed on Linux/macOS

2. **Sufficient disk space**: Extracted sosreports can be large
   - Check available space: `df -h .work/`
   - Recommend at least 2x the compressed archive size

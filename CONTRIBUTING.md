# Contributing to ai-helpers

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the ai-helpers plugin marketplace for Claude Code.

## Plugin Versioning Policy

All plugins use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **PATCH** (0.0.x): Bug fixes, typo corrections, minor improvements
- **MINOR** (0.x.0): New commands, skills, hooks, or features
- **MAJOR** (x.0.0): Breaking changes to existing commands

### When to bump versions

If your PR modifies plugin code (commands, skills, hooks, or plugin.json), you **MUST** bump the version:

1. Edit `plugins/<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
2. Increment the version appropriately
3. CI will fail if you forget

Documentation-only changes (README.md files) do not require version bumps.

### Example

Adding a new command to the `git` plugin:

```json
// Before
{
  "name": "git",
  "version": "0.1.0"
}

// After
{
  "name": "git",
  "version": "0.2.0"
}
```

### Why versioning matters

Claude Code caches plugins locally by version. Without version bumps:
- Users won't know updates exist
- Reinstalling may not fetch new code
- There's no way to track what version users have

## Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Bump the version in `plugin.json` if modifying plugin code
5. Run `make lint` to validate plugin structure
6. Submit a PR

### Testing your changes locally

You can test plugins locally before submitting:

1. Point Claude Code to your local fork:
   ```
   /plugin marketplace add <your-fork-url>
   ```

2. Install the plugin from your fork:
   ```
   /plugin install <plugin>@<your-marketplace-name>
   ```

## Auto-generated Documentation

The following files are auto-generated on merge and should **not** be edited manually:
- `PLUGINS.md`
- `docs/data.json`

These are regenerated by running `make update` which executes:
- `scripts/generate_plugin_docs.py`
- `scripts/build-website.py`

## Code Review

All PRs require review before merging. Reviewers will check:
- Plugin structure follows conventions (use `make lint`)
- Version is bumped appropriately for code changes
- Commands have proper frontmatter (description, argument-hint)
- No sensitive information is included

## Getting Help

If you have questions:
- Check existing plugins for examples
- Review the [Claude Code plugin documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins)
- Open an issue for discussion
